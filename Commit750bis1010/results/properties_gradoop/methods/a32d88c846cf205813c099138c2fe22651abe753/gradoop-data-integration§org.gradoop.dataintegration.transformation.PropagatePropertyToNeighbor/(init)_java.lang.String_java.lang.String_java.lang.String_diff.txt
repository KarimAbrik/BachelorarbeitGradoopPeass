/**
 * The constructor for the propagate property transformation. Additionally it is possible to
 * define which edge labels can be used for propagation and / or which vertices could be target
 * of the Properties.
 * <p>
 * Using this constructor, properties will be propagated along all edges and to all
 * target vertices. {@link #PropagatePropertyToNeighbor(String, String, String, Set, Set)}
 * can be used when properties should only be propagated along certain edges (selected by their
 * label) and / or to certain vertices (selected by their label). Using this constructor is
 * equivalent to {@code PropagatePropertyToNeighbor(vertexLabel, propertyKey,
 * targetVertexPropertyKey, null, null)}.
 *
 * @param vertexLabel             The label of the vertex the property to propagate is part of.
 * @param propertyKey             The property key of the property to propagate.
 * @param targetVertexPropertyKey The property key where the PropertyValue list should be stored
 *                                at the target vertices.
